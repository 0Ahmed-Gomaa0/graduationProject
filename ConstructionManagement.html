                <h2>Construction Management: Role, Importance, and Key Stages</h2>
                <p>Introduction
                Construction management is the process of planning, organizing, executing, 
                and monitoring construction projects to ensure the achievement of specified objectives
                in terms of quality, cost, and time. This management plays a crucial 
                role in ensuring that projects are executed efficiently and according to required standards.
                </p>
                <h2>Importance of Construction Management</h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>--> Achieving Efficiency: Helps optimize resource utilization and reduce waste.</p>
                    <p>--> Ensuring Quality: Guarantees compliance with engineering specifications and standards.</p>
                    <p>--> Reducing Risks: Helps anticipate potential issues and develop alternative plans.</p>

                </ul>   
                <h2>Key Stages of Construction Management</h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>--> Planning: Defines project scope, sets schedules, and calculates costs.</p>
                    <p>--> Design: Prepares engineering drawings and specifies materials to be used.</p>
                    <p>--> Execution: Construction operations begin according to the established plans.</p>
                    <p>--> Monitoring and Control: Tracks project progress and ensures compliance with specifications and quality standards.</p>
                    <p>--> Delivery: The project is handed over after completing all work and ensuring quality.</p>
                </ul>  
                <h2>Roles of Construction Management</h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>--> Strategic planning for projects.</p>
                    <p>--> Coordination between different teams.</p>
                    <p>--> Monitoring project execution and ensuring compliance with requirements.</p>
                    <p>--> Supervising the application of safety and quality standards.</p>
                    <p>--> Resolving problems that may arise during the project.</p>
